# Class 6 reading notes:


## 1. Reading assignment

   - **Problem domain:**
     1. Problem domains are very difficult when you don't have the full picture, which as developers we typically don't have the whole picture. Plus, the problem can look very different depending on what perspective youre looking at it from.
     2. Understanding the problem is the most important and sometimes most overlooked piece of the puzzle. A programmer can spend hours or days on a project, working without fully understanding what the project should look like when it's complete, only to be able to finish in a mere few hours once a full understanding of the expectation is provided.
     3. Though as coders, we want to get to the coding as soon as possible, it's worth taking a little bit of extra time talking to the customer/client to make sure you have a complete understanding of what is being built. What takes an extra couple of hours in time upfront can save days in the long run.
    
## 2. JavaScript and jQuery

   - **Chapter 3: "Object Literals" (p 100-105)**
     1. Objects are here to change our understanding of functions and variables, as they become known as different things when inside an object group. An object is a grouping of variables and functions to create something like what you would see in the world. For example, the "hotel" becomes an object, with the variables becoming properties (such as rooms, how may are booked/available, types of rooms, if there's a gym), and the function becomes a method (being able to check the availability). 
     2. Objects contain keys which appear in a combination of key/value pairs. The key is used to access it's corresponding value.
     3. Literal notation: One way to create objects: variable is created (the object name), and within the variable in curly braces the key/value pairs are listed, one per line, with a comma at the end. At the end (still within the curly braces) is the method, which is another key, but the value is a function. For future uses, the values within the object (the keys) can be retrieved in future variables with dot (.) notation. For example, "hotel.name;"
