# Reading Notes Class 8

## 1. HTML & CSS

  - **Chapter 7 "Forms" (p 144-175)**
    1. A "form" is an area for the user to input informataion. There are many "forms" in HTML, including a textbox, a password box, a text area (larger than a box, has multiple lines), all for adding text. Users can make choices via checkbox, radio buttons, and drop down boxes. And forms can be submitted by pressing submit buttons, image buttons, and a file upload box. The forms take the submitted information and store them in the database. One thing to keep in mind with radio buttons, they cannot be deselected, only have the selection changed. So if it's a situation like a person agreeing to something, a checkbox is better because it can be selected and deselected.
    2. There are hidden controls that can hide text or input from the user, but the author would be able to see it, which we will likely be using soon to hide the link to the sales.html page from the main index.html pageo n our salmon cookies project.
    3. A fieldset is an element that can group multiple input elements into one block on the screen, with a "legend" as a label. It is possible to require a box be filled in before the user can submit the form. That validation check can also check to make sure a date is valid, an email/URL is valid, and the search input is populated.
