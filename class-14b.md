# 1. What Google learned from trying to create the perfect team

  - **A.** This article begins by talking about a woman who was in a pre-arranged study group at Yale and the exeprience that the group was frequently in competition for the role of "leader" to such an extreme that everyone in the gorup would regularly criticize each other and their ideas. She found a group on campus that was self chosen with people from very different backgrounds and they clicked much better, having more trust and open dialogue than the group that was arranged for her based on similar background. 
  - **B.** In the last decade many tech employers are working on optimizing productivity, and are finding that group work tends to accomplish more in the same amount of time or less, than individual work, and mostakes are spotted much faster. About five years ago, Google began something called Project Aristotle and hired the woman from Yale to work on it, which focused on building the perfect teams. The project used decades worth of research regarding work groups and studied 180 groups across Google, but were unable to find a pattern that explained why certain groups were productive while others weren't as. After a significant amount of research, they determined that the way the members of the group treated each other was on of the biggest determining factors on if the group was successful. Also, when the peoplein the group had roughly equal talking time throughout the day, the groups collective IQ was higher than inthe groups where one or a few individuals dominated the speaking. The second way was teams whose members were good at reading nonverbal cues and expressions seemed to be able to intuit when someone in the group was feeling upset or left out and could adjust, while the other groups could not.
  - **C.** A summary of Project Aristotle is that it has made people at Google focus more on psychological safety at work and being aware of the other people on your team as actual people. They found that although people at Google love data and numbers, by putting things like empathy and emotion into a chart and data it made it easier to talk about, and improve sensitivity.
