# Class 03 Reading
## 1. HTML & CSS
   - **Chapter 3: Lists**
     1. There are multiple different types of lists, including ordered (ol) and unordered (ul), which are exactly as they sound. Ordered lists have numbers as bullet points, while unordered lists have bullet points instead of numbers. 
     2. There are also definition lists, that indent the definition under the term to be defined, as well as nested lists, which are very similar to how this page appears. They can have either ordered lists or unordered lists, but each indent (or child) will have a different style of numeration than the previous, either a different bullet point or a different style of numbering.
   - **Chapter 13: Boxes**
     1. EAch HTML element is essentially treated as it's own box, and the box is exactly big enough to house the text unless otherwise adjusted in CSS. Size can be changed of the boxes with width and height either in pixels or in percentages. Height and width can be limited in these settings as well if needed so if the browser tries to shrink or enlarge an item, it will not be larger or smaller than indicated. If there is more content than can display in the box, a scroll bar will be added so the user can see the whole information.
     2. Every type of box has a border (that goes around the edges of the box), padding (which is the space between the text and the border), and a margin (which is the space between the border and the next box). 
     3. Many of the properties can be adjusted for the border, including width (which would make the border appear larger or smaller), the style (such as a solid border, dotted, dashed, etc--changes the appearance of the border), and the color. These can all be combined into one line of style, with one written after the other (with a single space separating them).
     4. Padding and Margin are both controlled by pixels. They can be specified as one single direction (i.e. padding-left), or they can all be combined into one padding or margin line (i.e. padding: 0px 0px 5px 10px; for example. In this single line, the first number refers to the top, and goes in a clockwise direction)
     5. Content can also be centered once you have the specific size of the box selected.
     6. Other things that can be done with boxes include border images, box shadows, hidden boxes, and rounding the corners of the box with a style tag called border-radius, which is measured in pixels, and can either slightly round the edges or create an elliptical shape.
     
## 2. JavaScript and jQuery
   - **Chapter 2 (pages 70-73: Arrays)**
     1. An array stores a list of variables, especially when you don't know how many items are in a list or it could be long. A developer can use a literal array (which is created as a variable with the name array, and has values separated by a single comma within square brackets) or an array constructor, where the array uses the keyword "new" and the values are held withing regular parenthesis, still separated by a comma.
     2. You access items in an array by specifying the array name followed by the index number in brackets. The index number refers to where the item is in the array space. The positions begin at "0", so the first item is "0" the second is "1" and so on.
     3. You can change the values in an array by accessing the location, using an = sign, and placing the updated item in single quotes, in case you only needed to change one single value in the array, but leaving the rest of the space alone.
   - **Chapter 4: Decisions and Loops (pg 162-182)**
     1. When using if...else statements, if the "if" statement is true, then a certain code block runs, but if it's false, the "else" code block runs. 
     2. There are also switch statements, that has different cases that indicate a value if the variable is a different answer. 
     3. Javascript uses type coercion that converts data types behind the scenes, and uses weak typing because the data can change. There are also truthy and falsy values, though most everything returns as truthy.
     4. With javascript it is recommended to use "===" and "!==" as opposed to "==" and "!=", as they will be more accurate when checking equality between two values. Logical operators also get processed left to right, so if theres a short circuit, they will stop processing and the return will be true or false based on when it short circuited.
     5. Loops check a condition, and will continue to repeat until the code tells them to stop. If it isn't told to stop, it will run infinitely. Every time a loop runs i++, it adds a number to the previous value, and will only stop when the condition in the statement is met (for example, if the code is told to run until a number gets to 10). Loops can run in for loops, while loops, and do loops, which all tell the program what to do. For loops typically run through the numbers in an array, while loops state while a number is a certain thing, add one or add two until it gets to a certain spot.
