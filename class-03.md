   - **Chapter 3: Lists**
     1. There are multiple different types of lists, including ordered (ol) and unordered (ul), which are exactly as they sound. Ordered lists have numbers as bullet points, while unordered lists have bullet points instead of numbers. 
     2. There are also definition lists, that indent the definition under the term to be defined, as well as nested lists, which are very similar to how this page appears. They can have either ordered lists or unordered lists, but each indent (or child) will have a different style of numeration than the previous, either a different bullet point or a different style of numbering.
