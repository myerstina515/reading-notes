# Class 03 Reading
## 1. HTML & CSS
   - **Chapter 3: Lists**
     1. There are multiple different types of lists, including ordered (ol) and unordered (ul), which are exactly as they sound. Ordered lists have numbers as bullet points, while unordered lists have bullet points instead of numbers. 
     2. There are also definition lists, that indent the definition under the term to be defined, as well as nested lists, which are very similar to how this page appears. They can have either ordered lists or unordered lists, but each indent (or child) will have a different style of numeration than the previous, either a different bullet point or a different style of numbering.
   - **Chapter 13: Boxes**
     1. EAch HTML element is essentially treated as it's own box, and the box is exactly big enough to house the text unless otherwise adjusted in CSS. Size can be changed of the boxes with width and height either in pixels or in percentages. Height and width can be limited in these settings as well if needed so if the browser tries to shrink or enlarge an item, it will not be larger or smaller than indicated. If there is more content than can display in the box, a scroll bar will be added so the user can see the whole information.
     2. Every type of box has a border (that goes around the edges of the box), padding (which is the space between the text and the border), and a margin (which is the space between the border and the next box). 
     3. Many of the properties can be adjusted for the border, including width (which would make the border appear larger or smaller), the style (such as a solid border, dotted, dashed, etc--changes the appearance of the border), and the color. These can all be combined into one line of style, with one written after the other (with a single space separating them).
     4. Padding and Margin are both controlled by pixels. They can be specified as one single direction (i.e. padding-left), or they can all be combined into one padding or margin line (i.e. padding: 0px 0px 5px 10px; for example. In this single line, the first number refers to the top, and goes in a clockwise direction)
     5. Content can also be centered once you have the specific size of the box selected.
     6. Other things that can be done with boxes include border images, box shadows, hidden boxes, and rounding the corners of the box with a style tag called border-radius, which is measured in pixels, and can either slightly round the edges or create an elliptical shape.
