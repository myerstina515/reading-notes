      1. You can control all aspects of image presentation including size. Specifying the size helps pages to load better becasue the code ususally loads before the iamges do, so they automatically load at the right size, instead of having to change once it has already loaded. If you have lots of images on the page, giving them classes like small, medium, large, can help to limit the number of sizing changes that need to be done in the CSS. Images can be added on their own or in line with another tag (like paragraph, for example), and they will appear inline with the content. Then they can be moved to the right, left, or center.
      2. The developer can use images as a background as well, either for the entire page or only part of a page. The background-image property also allows things like gradients to be used in the background. An image can also be used over and over in the background or for a border by using the background-repeat property.
      3. Background-position changes the overall position of the image (top, center, or bottom, as well as left, center, or right. The positions get combined to go over 9 different positionings). Images can also be edited with photo editing software to make them lighter and more appropriate for use as a background.
