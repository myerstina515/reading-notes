# Class 4 reading notes

## 1. HTML & CSS

   - **Chapter 4: Links**
     1. Links are inserted to the HTML document with the &lt;a&gt; tag. They can link to webpages, by placing the webpage in the opening tag, using an href to call the link, and can name it something by entering in text between the opening and closing tags. The text can be anything, and it will transform the text into a hyperlink. These are called absolute URL's, as you are accessing content that is not on your current website.
     2. There are also relative links, which take you to another page within your same webpage. Whether that's the main index page, or other files, such as a reviews page, or an about the company page. 
     3. You can also use links to send an email to someone (the owner of the page or company), and the target link to open the specified link in a new browser.
   - **Chapter 15: Layout**
