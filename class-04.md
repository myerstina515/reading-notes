# Class 4 reading notes

## 1. HTML & CSS

   - **Chapter 4: Links**
     1. Links are inserted to the HTML document with the &lt;a&gt; tag. They can link to webpages, by placing the webpage in the opening tag, using an href to call the link, and can name it something by entering in text between the opening and closing tags. The text can be anything, and it will transform the text into a hyperlink. These are called absolute URL's, as you are accessing content that is not on your current website.
     2. There are also relative links, which take you to another page within your same webpage. Whether that's the main index page, or other files, such as a reviews page, or an about the company page. 
     3. You can also use links to send an email to someone (the owner of the page or company), and the target link to open the specified link in a new browser.
   - **Chapter 15: Layout**
     1. HTML elements are treated by CSS as if they are boxes, as discussed in previous reading "boxes". They can be block level or inline blocks (which flow inside of surrounding text. Multiple methods are used to position the elements. They can be kept in normal flow (on a new line), they can have relative positioning (able to be moved up/down/left/right, but does not effect surrounding elements), absolute positioning (where the element is in an area outside of the flow, and any text that appears behind it acts as if it does not exist), fixed position (also does not change surrounding elements, stays in the exact same space on the browser, despite any scrolling up or down the user does), and floating elements, which will be discussed on the next line.
     2. Floating elements are taken out of flow of the rest of the document, positioned in the top left or top right corner, and allows other content to wrap around it. Float is how blockquotes are able to appear inline with text wrapped around it, it's how columns and articles can appear on a front page. Multiple elements are floated, and they will appear one next to the other along the top, provided there is enough space.
     3. As technology had advanced, there are multiple different screen sizes to consider. Most developers create websites to be roughly 960-1000px wide so it is able to fit a wider variety of monitor sizes. Fixed layouts are more difficult to fit to different computer screens, as they primarily deal in pixels, while liquid layouts work better with the varying screen sizes currently, as they adjust based on percentages to better fit the varieties of screens.

## 2. JavaScript and jQuery
   - **Chapter 3: Functions, Methods, and Objects (only pages 86-99)**
