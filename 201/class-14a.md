# Reading Notes Class 14

# 1. What Google learned from trying to create the perfect team

  - **A.** This article begins by talking about a woman who was in a pre-arranged study group at Yale and the exeprience that the group was frequently in competition for the role of "leader" to such an extreme that everyone in the gorup would regularly criticize each other and their ideas. She found a group on campus that was self chosen with people from very different backgrounds and they clicked much better, having more trust and open dialogue than the group that was arranged for her based on similar background. 
  - **B.** In the last decade many tech employers are working on optimizing productivity, and are finding that group work tends to accomplish more in the same amount of time or less, than individual work, and mostakes are spotted much faster. About five years ago, Google began something called Project Aristotle and hired the woman from Yale to work on it, which focused on building the perfect teams. The project used decades worth of research regarding work groups and studied 180 groups across Google, but were unable to find a pattern that explained why certain groups were productive while others weren't as. After a significant amount of research, they determined that the way the members of the group treated each other was on of the biggest determining factors on if the group was successful. Also, when the peoplein the group had roughly equal talking time throughout the day, the groups collective IQ was higher than inthe groups where one or a few individuals dominated the speaking. The second way was teams whose members were good at reading nonverbal cues and expressions seemed to be able to intuit when someone in the group was feeling upset or left out and could adjust, while the other groups could not.
  - **C.** A summary of Project Aristotle is that it has made people at Google focus more on psychological safety at work and being aware of the other people on your team as actual people. They found that although people at Google love data and numbers, by putting things like empathy and emotion into a chart and data it made it easier to talk about, and improve sensitivity.
  
# 2. CSS Transforms
  - **A.** The transform property changes the shape of the element by either 2D or 3D means including rotating, scaling, translating, skewing, and combining transformations to change the appearance of the box. You can change perspective and depth, as well as origin.

# 3. Transitions and Animations
  - **A.** Transitions occur when a change of state occurs to an element, such as hovering on an element or focusing on it. These are called pseudo classes. The transitional property determines exactly which properties will change during the trnasition, and if there are multiple, they are separated by a comma. Not all properties can be transitioned, there is a specific list of those that can be. THe transition duration specifies how long the transition will take to complete, and if there are multiple, there needs to be a value specified for each, also separated with a comma. 
  - **B.** To complete any animation, a keyframe property is required with the type of animation (i.e. slide). In any animation, it is required to state the duartion, the timing, and the delay. You can also change the directio, the play state, and the fill mode. 
  
# 4. 8 simple transitions to wow users
  - **A** The 8 transitions are as follows: Fade-in, change color, grow and shrink, rotate elements, square to circle, 3D shadow, swing (moves the image left and right), and inset border.


# 5. 6 buttons animated
  - **A.** So... 6 buttons animated should really be called 3 buttons animated. There are 3, although it's pretty neat to see how much code goes into making the buttons move just a little bit, and stop when the mouse hovers over them or clicks on them. I can't wait to try this one out.


# 6. CSS animations: Keyframes
  - **A.** The bouncing ball is really cool, but just as cool as that is the link on the right to message them. The box opens slowly, not immediately and there are effects on that as well. And it looks to be connected to FB messenger, as the speech bubble looks like the blue of FB messenger.


# 7. 404
  - **A.** It's interesting to see how the 0 gets larger in the middle and the 4's on either side shrink and end up inside the opening of the 0. Its neat to see how all of the animation and transitions work together to create things like this.


# 8. Pure CSS Bounce Animation
  - **A.** So the ball is cool how it bounces, but then as it's bouncing it turns into a square and the colors change and a larger cirle appears that encircles the bouncing circle/square...
