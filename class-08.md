# Reading Notes: Class 8

## 1. HTML & CSS book

   - **Chapter 15: Layout**
     1. HTML elements are treated by CSS as if they are boxes. They can be block level or inline blocks (which flow inside of surrounding text). Multiple methods are used to position the elements. They can be kept in normal flow (on a new line), they can have relative positioning (able to be moved up/down/left/right, but does not effect surrounding elements), absolute positioning (where the element is in an area outside of the flow, and any text that appears behind it acts as if it does not exist), fixed position (also does not change surrounding elements, stays in the exact same space on the browser, despite any scrolling up or down the user does), and floating elements, which will be discussed on the next line.
     2. Floating elements are taken out of flow of the rest of the document, positioned in the top left or top right corner, and allows other content to wrap around it. Float is how blockquotes are able to appear inline with text wrapped around it, it's how columns and articles can appear on a front page. Multiple elements are floated, and they will appear one next to the other along the top, provided there is enough space.
     3. As technology had advanced, there are multiple different screen sizes to consider. Most developers create websites to be roughly 960-1000px wide so it is able to fit a wider variety of monitor sizes. Fixed layouts are more difficult to fit to different computer screens, as they primarily deal in pixels, while liquid layouts work better with the varying screen sizes currently, as they adjust based on percentages to better fit the varieties of screens.
     4. When block-level elements are in normal flow, the can have a static position. These elements need to be provided with properties for the size, otherwise they can span across the entire webpage width. Width property is important to specify. There is also the fixed position, where the information stays in the same place, so that when the webpage scrolls down, the box remains in the exact same place. This gets utilized when websites have a navigation bar or the developer wants the title bar to remain at the top of the page regardless of scrolling.
     5. The z-index is referred to as the stacking context, which works like the command of "bring to front" or "send to back", and is a factor in overlapping elements. This is where one element is in front of the other, but both are visible, and taking up the same space.
     6. If you decide to use a float element and the elements are directly side by side, you can use the clear property to place space on the specified side of the box. Additional information on floated elements will likely come in handy during the next day of lab: Parents of floated elements. If the parent element is not given the right properties, it will appear as a collapsed box, or rather, a solid line. The overflow property must be given a value of auto and the width property set to a value (i.e. 100%) to fix this potential issue.
     7. Another likely element we are reviewing today is the 960 Grid System. It's a CSS framework that creates multiple column layouts for you. grid spaces can take up anywhere from 1-12 columns of the grid which can help to create a layout for the webpage, including areas for navigation links, columns, the feature, as well as footers with copyright information. This chapter also introduces the multiple stylesheets idea, where there can be (and likely should be) more than one stylesheet for a webpage. Each one would contain different pieces of the puzzle, one for formatting, one for colors and design, etc. It helps to make the document more reader friendly and more difficult to break.
