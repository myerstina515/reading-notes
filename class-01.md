#Reading Assignment 1

##1. HTML & CSS

  - **Introduction:**
      1. Discusses the structure of the book, divides it up into three main sections including HTML, CSS, and Practical. 
      2. Talks a little bit about how the internet works, when you enter a web address and it returns the content.
  - **Chapter 1: Structure**
      1. The structure of an HTML document is essentially a text document. It can have larger and smaller headings, bold or italicized text, and paragraphs.
      2. Elements and tags are used to provide structure to the document. For example &lt:p&gt: is an example of an opening tag for a paragraph. After the text is filled in, there is a closing tag &lt:/p&gt: to indicate an end of the element.
      3. Coding on a Mac vs PC is slightly different, however the biggest difference is the name of the text editors and where to find them. 
  - **Chapter 8: Extra Markups**
      1. There are many different versions of HTML, the most recent of which is HTML 5. It is usable and supported on many platforms, but is not complete yet. A developer specifies which version is being used by specifying a doctype at the beginning of the document.
      2. Elements can be grouped in many ways. They can be grouped by "class" or "id" so they may be styled with similar elements, and can be grouped visually with block or inline elements. Block elements change the way the document is formatted, but inline elements changes the appearance of a selection of words within the text.
      3. Escape characters are important for developers to be aware of. There are certain characters, such as &lt: and &gt: that are used with coding and indicate certain things (tags in this case), so there are special codes to make them appear in text.
