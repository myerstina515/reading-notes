# Reading Notes for Class 2

## 1. HTML & CSS
  - **Chapter 2: Text**
       1. There are may different tags to display text. Some examples are various heading sizes (h1-h6), generic text (p), emphasis tags for bold (b) and italics(i), as well as line breaks (br), and horizontal lines (hr).
       2. Bold and italic text can also be denoted as strong (strong which is equivalent to "bold"), and emphasis (em which is equivalent to "italic". 
       3. There are other tags that will produce similar results with italic text, though another tag type is strikethrough or "del", which both create a single line through the text.
           
  - **Chapter 10: Introducing CS**
       1. CSS declarations change characteristics of the HTML document, such as text and background color, font, size, and any other apperance. A declaration consists of a selector (which communicates what element you want to adjust), the property (which is the charagteristic you are changing), and the value (which is the new setting you want to appear).
       2. There are external and internal CSS, external has you link to a CSS page, where you make all needed changes for the document, while internal goes on the same page as the HTML and can be specified in the "head" of the page or in each individual tag.
       3. Multiple versions of CSS have existed, though CSS3 is the most current and is implemented in most major browsers.
