# Reading Notes for Class 2

## 1. HTML & CSS
  - **Chapter 2: Text**
       1. There are may different tags to display text. Some examples are various heading sizes (h1-h6), generic text (p), emphasis tags for bold (b) and italics(i), as well as line breaks (br), and horizontal lines (hr).
       2. Bold and italic text can also be denoted as strong (strong which is equivalent to "bold"), and emphasis (em which is equivalent to "italic". 
       3. There are other tags that will produce similar results with italic text, though another tag type is strikethrough or "del", which both create a single line through the text.
           
  - **Chapter 10: Introducing CS**
       1. CSS declarations change characteristics of the HTML document, such as text and background color, font, size, and any other apperance. A declaration consists of a selector (which communicates what element you want to adjust), the property (which is the charagteristic you are changing), and the value (which is the new setting you want to appear).
       2. There are external and internal CSS, external has you link to a CSS page, where you make all needed changes for the document, while internal goes on the same page as the HTML and can be specified in the "head" of the page or in each individual tag.
       3. Multiple versions of CSS have existed, though CSS3 is the most current and is implemented in most major browsers.
       
 ## 2. JavaScript and jQuery
  - **Chapter 2: Basic JavaScript Instructions**
       1. JAvaScript is case sensitive, and instructions are written in camel case. Comments are able to be inserted with /* or with // (The first to denote multi line comments, the second for a single line of comments)
       2. Variables are stored for future use with the code "var" followed by the name you want used as the variable name. They can be recalled throughout the remainder of the document, provided they haven't been changed along the way.
       3. JavaScript is made up of values called strings which are words kept between two single quotes ('value'), numbers which don't require quotes, and boolean values which are either true or false.
       4. A special type of variable is an array, which stores lists of values inside brackets (such as example[value1, value2]). Arrays are lists that start with number 0, so the value in the first place acutally has a value of 0, in the second place its value is 1, and so on. When accessing variables, you "call" the variable with the value, not the position. For example, if you take the array above, and wanted to access the first value you would call it example[0]
       5. You can do basic math with JavaScript, and the program will follow the order of operations.
