# Redux - Additional Topics
## Review, Research, and Discussion
  1. What’s the best practice for “pre-loading” data into the store (on application start) in a Redux application? You create an "initial state" that is immutable, then can change the state by replacing it as you go on.
  2. When using a thunk/async action that dispatches the actual action, which do you export from your reducer? A function
  
#### Vocabulary
  1. middleware: The stop signs along the train tracks of the web request response cycle. It extends the functionality of the code base
  2. thunk: Built in middleware in redux, it acts as the glue to hold together the functions and actions, and helps to handle async API calls.
  
## Preview
  1. Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on? thunk makes a decent amount of sense, initial state, and reducers
  2. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo? testing, testing, and testing for react
  3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works? testing in react. I don't feel like we've gone over it very much, and we certainly haven't had time to focus on it during labs...
