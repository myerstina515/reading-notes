# AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

## Review, Research, and Discussion
  1. Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?Fifo queues are essentially the same, but supports ordering and ensures exactly once procesing to make sure there are no duplicated tasks running.
  2. How can the server be assured a message was properly received?Add a response/confirmation into the program so the server will receive an "all clear" signal so it knows the message was delivered and read.
  3. What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?A messaging service?
  4. How do you test an event driven system? Unit tests, service tests, and end to end tests source
  5. Vocabulary:
    - A. Serverless Functions: Serverless functions are single purpose functions that are hosted on a managed hosting tool, written for a single purpose, like on Lambda
    - B. Cloud Storage: Off site remote storage space, hosted by a cloud infrastructure platform, where you can take up exactly how much computing space you require, no more and no less.
    - C. CDN: Content Delivery Network: geographic distribution of servers so it takes less time for the information to transfer from the cloud storage to the user.
