# Gatsby, next.js, and other JS Frameworks
## Review, Research, and Discussion
  1. What does React Native do when it builds your application? It allows you to build applications that work on both andriod and apple phones with the javascript language we already have an understanding of. It acts as a translator for the native language for the device you're running your app on.
  2. Can you simply deploy a react web app to the phone? I found that no, you cannot. You can deploy a react native app to your phone with snack.expo.io, but for your app to be downloadable and in the app store you have to pay a fee to sign up with a developer account.
  
#### Vocabulary
  1. eject: gives you full control over the configuration files and dependencies
  2. android avd: Android Virtual Device: a configuration that defines the characteristics of an Android device that you want to run in the android simulator
  3. expo: a set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms that help you do anything you need to do with your app to make it compatible with android and apple.
  
### Preview
  1. Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on? I still have just a brief understanding of react native, have more understanding of how expo works.
  2. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo? Learning more about what Gatsby is, as well as getting a taste of angular and php, which I've heard about before, but don't fully understand still.
  3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works? I'm the most curious about PHP, just because I've heard a lot about it and want to know what it really does.
