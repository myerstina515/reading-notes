# Props and State

## Review, Research, and Discussion

  1. Does a deployed React application require a server? You don't necessarily need a static server, it can work with an existing server, but it does still need a server to deploy.
  2. Why do we prefer to test a React application at the behavior rather than the unit level? React is more modularized than traditional javascript and it's easier to ensure the correct behavior occurs versus traditional unit testing.
  3. What does npm run build do? It will create a build directory with a production build of your app. [source](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment)
  4. Describe the actual composition / architecture of a React application: They use a component centric file layout so everything that is related is located together.
  
### Vocabulary
  1. BDD: Behavior Driven Development: a form of test driven development where each test is based off of a user story so it is more readable.
  2. Acceptance Tests: Determines if the software meets the expectations
  3. mounting: When the DOM renders something for the first time.
  4. build: all the components of an app put together.
  
## Preview

  1. Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on? I had heard of SASS, but did not know what it was in compairson to basic CSS, react rendering, and I had seen the npx command but didn't know how to use it.
  2. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo? More about react, testing in react, and how to use routes in react.
  3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works? All of it
