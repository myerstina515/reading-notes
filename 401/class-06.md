# Reading Notes Class 6

## Review, Research, and Discussion

  1. Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms)
    - An alternative to global variables and static classes, it refers to a pattern that restricts instantiation to a single instance. It's common to use them with a "factory" which churns out lots of objects that are the same as each other, it simplifies the code. 
    - They don't take up space like global variables do, but they can have parameters passed to them and they are able to have their instances swapped out for testing. [reference](https://medium.com/better-programming/what-is-a-singleton-2dc38ca08e92)
  2. Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes.

  3. If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?
