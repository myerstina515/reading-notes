# Data Modelling

## Review, Research, and Discussion
  - Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development: higher code quality, maintenance is easier, development takes less time in the long run because the code base is easier to read and adjust.
  - In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite? If you aren't completely sure what a test does, it will help to make it more clear.
  - What is one downside of Test Driven Development: Takes longer to write the code initially
  - Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes? The biggest difference is how the ES6 classes can be "extended" from a constructor, while the constructor/prototype classes are more static and can be used, but not built off of in the same way.
  - Why REST? REST is incredibly flexible and is utilized on most evey browser and is stateless. 
  
## Vocabulary
  - functional programming: Type of programming that focuses on pure functions that always return the same result, given the same input, and emphasizes the application of fuctions.
  - object-oriented programming (OOP): Type of programming that stores data in objects and have classes that tell us how to construct the object.
  - class: a blueprint that defines the structure of something in different types of programming styles.
  - super: Refers to the parent class in programming.
  - this: the object instance that "this" appears in.
  - Test Driven Development (TDD): a development process that relies on tests to confirm or deny working code based on pre-set goals of the code.
  - Jest: a testing javascript framework that allows you to write specific test for functionality of code.
  - Continuous Integration (CI): A form of software building where test are frequently run  any time code is pushed into a repository. By having CI running, tests must pass before code is able to be deployed. Goes hand in hand with CD.
  - REST: Representational State Transfer 
  - Data Model: a visual representation of how different layers of code interact with one another. 


## Preview
  - Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on? ES6 classes, testing, and more about why REST is as useful as it is.
  - Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo? Testing, CI/CD, and more about the specifics of using Jest.
  - What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works? I want to do more with the whiteboarding we've been working on for code challenges. I finally started to feel like I understand it today, and I"m excited to see if I really do, or if it's a fluke.
