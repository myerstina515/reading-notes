# Data Modelling

## Review, Research, and Discussion
  - Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development: higher code quality, maintenance is easier, development takes less time in the long run because the code base is easier to read and adjust.
  - In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite? If you aren't completely sure what a test does, it will help to make it more clear.
  - What is one downside of Test Driven Development: Takes longer to write the code initially
  - Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes? The biggest difference is how the ES6 classes can be "extended" from a constructor, while the constructor/prototype classes are more static and can be used, but not built off of in the same way.
  - Why REST? REST is incredibly flexible and is utilized on most evey browser and is stateless.
