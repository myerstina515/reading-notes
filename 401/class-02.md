## Reading Notes Class 02

### Review, Research, Discussion:

  1. What’s the difference between PUT and PATCH?
  2. Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like json-server
  3. Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?
  4. Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST
  
  5. Vocabulary Terms:
    * Web Server: "serves" information (or a website) to the front end client side. It handles all of the processing and storing of data, and is essentially the host of a webiste.
    * Express: Express is a javascript framework that allows developers to create the server side of web applications.
    * Routing: Routing provides pathways to send a user from one area of a website to another based on what the user does on the client side.
    * WRRC: Web Request/Response Cycle: the cycle of back-end web development that begins with the client side request of information to the server, and the response of the server to the client side with the requested information. The front end and server side are one example of this, another is the server side interacting with API's, as well as the server side interacting with a database.
