# Component Based UI

## Review, research, and discussion
  1. Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React): Node.js, chart.js, jQuery, jest, mocha
  2. Whatâ€™s the difference between a framework and a library? When you use a framework, the framwork is in control, but while using a library, you are in control. By using a framework, the user has to adapt the code to fit the framework, while with libraries the developer can call upon it as they choose to.

### Vocabulary
  1. Rendering: A render is a technique for sharing code between components, whose value is a function. 
  2. Templates: A chunk of HTML you need to put onto the page. 
  3. State: In react, a state is an object that represents a part of an app that is able to be changed. Each component has it's own "state" that lives in the "this".
