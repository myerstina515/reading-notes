# Component Based UI

## Review, research, and discussion
  1. Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React): Node.js, chart.js, jQuery, jest, mocha
  2. Whatâ€™s the difference between a framework and a library? When you use a framework, the framwork is in control, but while using a library, you are in control. By using a framework, the user has to adapt the code to fit the framework, while with libraries the developer can call upon it as they choose to.

### Vocabulary
  1. Rendering: A render is a technique for sharing code between components, whose value is a function. 
  2. Templates: A chunk of HTML you need to put onto the page. 
  3. State: In react, a state is an object that represents a part of an app that is able to be changed. Each component has it's own "state" that lives in the "this". [reference](https://daveceddia.com/visual-guide-to-state-in-react/#:~:text=In%20the%20React%20sense%2C%20%E2%80%9Cstate,in%20an%20object%20called%20this.)

## Preview
  1. Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on? I have a much better understanding of the jest style of testing after project week, routing, and MongoDB.
  2. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo? React, a refresher on front end, and hopefully using more libraries with react.
  3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works? I'm excited for the react portion of this class, I've been looking forward to it the whole time.
  
### Reactjs.org

  1. JSX: syntax extension to javascript. It looks like a combination of javascript and HTML. React deals with how the UI should look at that particular moment in time, and only refreshes what it needs to. 
  2. By calling ReactDOM.render(), we are able to take declared variables, manipulate the DOM, and update the UI.
  3. It can be used in for loops and if conditionals, with different results shown with each.
  4. JSX tags can be self closing, as with HTML, can have descendants, can be written in object form, and the objects are called "react elements".
  5. React DOM takes care of updating the DOM.
