# AWS: Cloud Servers

## Review, Research, and Discussion

  1. What’s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue? Fifo queues are essentially the same, but supports ordering and ensures exactly once procesing to make sure there are no duplicated tasks running.
  2. How can the server be assured a message was properly received? Add a response/confirmation into the program so the server will receive an "all clear" signal so it knows the message was delivered and read.
  3. What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming? A messaging service
  4. How do you test an event driven system? Unit tests, service tests, and end to end tests [source](https://medium.com/dan-on-coding/testing-event-driven-systems-63c6b0c57517)
  
  5. Vocabulary:
    - Server: Hardware or software that provides functionality for other programs or devices
    - Pub/Sub: Publish–subscribe pattern: asynchronous messaging service
    - WRRC: Web request response cycle: A cycle of a client requesting information from a server, and the server sending the response back to the client.
    
## Preview
  1. Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on? I don't feel like I have much clarity right now at all...
  2. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo? binary searches, testing binary searches, brief review of concepts from this last week.
  3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works? Testing. Always testing

## VMS and the Cloud

1. virtualization: allows us to better utilize the resources we have on our machine.
2. Hypervisior: software that allows us to create virtual machines
3. Allows us to have fewer physical machines, lowering capital expenditures. 
4. Cloud computing: when we need additional resources, we add a server and add more virtual machines.
5. If you are in one place and your computer or computing is in a different place, you are using cloud computing.

## AWS EC2
  - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud: web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
