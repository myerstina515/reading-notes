# React Native
## Review, Research, and Discussion
  1. Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”: Redux Toolkit is a package for redux that helps to reduce the react boilerplace and is a standard way to write the logic, but ducks works to modularaize all of the react code. It can put all of the actions and intial state reducers into one file and enables the developer to remove the other folders, helping the code to be much more manageable and organized.

  2. What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit: it's flexible and can be combined with normal redux without problem.
  
#### Vocabulary
  1. redux toolkit slices: a collection of reducer logic and actions for a single file of the app.
  2. namespace: allows the user to access parts of a component using dot notation rather than a variable assignment. It allows information to be transferred from the parent to the child elements.
  
## Getting started with react native
  1. react native is a framework for writing mobile apps
  2. Typically with Andriod development, you use Java or Kotlin, while with iOS, typically swift or Objective-C are used, but with react native you can build your own native components, and react native will look and feel like any other platform specific mobile app.
  3. There are some different components with a mobile app, like swiping for example, but this is a tutuorial that takes you through all the different basic components in mobile app development.
