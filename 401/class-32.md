# Custom Hooks

## Review, research, and discussion:
  1. What does a component’s lifecycle refer to? Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting of the component
  2. Why do you sometimes need to “wrap” functions in useCallback when called from within useEffect? will help avoid regeneration when only one component is re-rendered.
  3. Why are functional components preferred over class components? They are easier to read and test
  4. What is wrong with the following code? Can't access the event in the setState
  
### Vocabulary
  1. state hook: allows you to have state variables in functional components
  2. effect hook: Allows you to perform side effects (or additional instruction) after rendering
  3. reducer hook: returns the current state paired with a dispatch method
