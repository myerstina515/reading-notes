## 1. Chart.js

  -**a. Chart.js is an HTML plugin** that creates charts and animation on screen. Lines, pie charts, and bar charts can be created with different colors and sizes. It goes over the installation instructions, but I'm going to wait until class time to see what we are supposed to do with it.
  
## 2. "Canvas element"

  -**a. The canvas element** has fixed height and width, but no other properties specified within it. It creates a blank drawing surface on the page. Changes to other properties can still be made in CSS, but these changes dont effect the drawing on the page.The canvas tag is similar to the img tag, but requires both opening and closing tags separated, where with the img tag it can be a self closing tag or two separate ones.
