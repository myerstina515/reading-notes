# Reading Notes Class 7

## A conversation with my brother

  1. This is actually a really interesting article/conversation between two people, that explains how the internet works in a very relatable way. The author talks to his brother about things like the HTTP protocol, created by Roy Fielding among others, that helped design how the modern internet works. It talks about REST (which stands for Representational State Transfer), which provides a definition of a resource. He talks about tactile items in real life being the equivalent of web pages, and starts talking about the verbs of what can happen to them. THey can be picked up, dropped, thrown, but the main word he comes back to time and time again is "get" which is what we've been learning about the last couple classes, along with "put" and "delete". Although we go over these concepts in class, it give a different perspective and helps explain these concepts in real life terms, and makes everything a little bit more clear.
  
## Super Agent (skim/bookmark)
  1. It is bookmarked, but I"m going to try to summarize it anyway, as it does seem to help me understand the different frameworks better: Super Agent is an ajax API that is very flexible and works with Node. At first glance, many of the terminology is very silimar to Node, which makes sense that they work well together. "Get", "set", and "then" seem to be very common while skimming through the content, query() accepts new objects. jQuery and Form are automaticlaly supported by Super Agent. It's interesting that you can set "retry" so it will automatically retry a certain number of times before throwing an error. There are specific sets of instruction needed before pulling from certain API's such as facebook, where if a line of code is missing it will not produce the expected code. There are several other things that SuperAgent can do, including setting timeouts, authenticating, redirecting, and storing cookies.
