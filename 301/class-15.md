# Reading Notes Class 15

## Silicon Valley's gender gap is the result of computer-game marketing 20 years ago:

1. In 2014, over 70% of employees at top tech companies were men, and that increased with tech-heavy roles: only 10% of the workforce was women, which is actually a significant decrease over the previous 30 years. There has always been a significant bias toward males in computer advertising, as well as games geared more toward males than females, which they think encourages these trends. These trends continue into employment, where 44% of women want to leave the field within 3 years of entering.
