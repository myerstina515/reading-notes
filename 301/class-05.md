## Heroku tutorial through "view logs"

  1. Ok, so I followed the tutorial through "view logs" and it is all installed properly on my machine. I opened the node.js page, but it didn't say anything about completing things, so I left it alone.
  
## Skim Heroku deployment

  1. Heroku uses node.js for server side website production, and the tutorial sounds like it takes us through building a server on heroku. It has us start by making a js file and follow some basic insturctions, and then we have a server. Once we have a server, we can check it with our smart phones or tablets, which we find by entering our laptops' IP address on our local network. The tutorial takes us through a number of steps to declare variables, and create folders to place all our information inside of, and takes us through lines of code and installation instructions to create a blog page.
