##  Database Normalization Explained in Simple English

  1. A process to organize a database into columns and rows. You limit a spreadsheet to one single purpose, so it can do that one thing very well, like a function, since functions are supposed to do one thing and only one thing very well. 
  2. Three main reasons to normalize a database: First, you minimize data duplication, the second is to avoid data modification issues, and the last is to simplify queries. There are 3 different types of normalization, called 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, or abbreviated as 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF.
