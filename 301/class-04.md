# Reading Notes Class-04

## CSS Grid Garden

  1. Finished! Not sure how to insert an image, but I'll try to attach it in my copy/paste in Canvas. Also, the last 3 levels took me longer than the first 25.
  
## Regex
 
  1. Regex stands for regular expressions, and is helpful with extracting information from any text. It can validate and pass strings and works with almost every language. There are a good number of topics and classes/operators that were listed in the page, which is bookmarked, but difficult to "summarize". One interesting feature of regex is that "." isn't used very often because there's a different way of notating class or negate class which are "\d \w and \s" or the uppercase version for negating a class.There are also flags that indicate how values match. With regex, teh developer is able to use grouping (extracts information from strings in your preferred programming language) and bracket expressions (in brackets all special expressions lose their powers), as well as greedy/lazy match (which makes use of a quesiton mark to mark a div as lazy and is less strict). "boundaries": represents an anchor like a caret, "back-references": "\1" which captures the same text matched in the first or second, and "look-ahead and look-behind": matches only if it is preceeded or followed by the same text.
  
## Grid
  1. Similar formatting between this one and the flexbox tutorial. Grid uses a 2-D system that arranges boxes on the screen in a grid-based layout syestem. Grid and flexbox work well together, this is intended for more complex layouts, while flexbox is intended for more simple layouts. Grid containers are essentially the parent elements, while grid items are the child elements. Grid lines can be vertical or horizontal, while grid cells are the individual boxes of the elements. The grid area is the whole number of cells the selected area takes up. There are properties of both the parent and child, the parent elements primarily work with the templates and the display, while the child elements work primarily with the start/end and the area properties. With grid, you can align self, place self, and justify items. There are far more properties to work with on the parent elements than the child elements.
  
## Responsive Web Design with Grid
  1. Large image followed by articles is a common layout on websites which will place a large image at the top and use grid to auto fill as many elements as possile in the rest of the space. Full page image gallery uses features to create different sizes of boxes. Card layout fills each column with cards as the screen width increases. Holy Grail Layout: Has a header and footer that stick no matter what the width or height of the screen with a content section that splits between two sides and a main section in the middle.
