# Reading Notes Class-03

## Template with Mustache
  1. Mustache is a logic less template syntax. It can be used for anything and still shrinks down content in a similar fashion to JSON, but removes all logical commands (i.e. if, for, while, etc). It uses double curly braces as placeholders. Mustache express is a method of being able to use mustache with Node and Express together and goes through installation instructions. I attempted to install, but it wouldn't recognize it on my computer.


## A Guide to Flexbox
  1. We were introduced to this article in 201, but I will summarize and notate here. Flexbox is supposed to be a much easier method of arranging boxes on the screen vs. the float property and other positioning tools. There are flex containers that work with the parent element as well as flex items that work with the children elements. It allows the developer to change the direction and size of the boxes, change the wrapping style, as well as the alignment and justification of the boxes. There is a very long list of individual commands, and rather than listing them out, I have bookmarked the page and will continue to refer back to it during our flexbox lab coming up.


## Flexbox Froggy
  1. Completed! I do feel like it gave me a better understanding of flex-box, curious if we need to submit a screenshot of anything?
